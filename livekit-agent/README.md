# LiveKit Agent

A voice AI project built with [LiveKit Agents for Python](https://github.com/livekit/agents) and [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project was converted to code from the LiveKit Agent Builder. The code is identical to production deployments from the builder. Follow the steps below to make it your own and deploy it to LiveKit Cloud. once you do so, you can delete the version in the builder.

## Next steps

### Run and deploy your agent

**Get your agent running locally and in production:**

1. **Run locally**: Follow the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section below to set up your environment and test the agent
2. **Deploy to production**: See the [Deploy to production](#deploy-to-production) section for deployment options and best practices

### Quickstart

**Get up and running** so you can start customizing:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```console
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Set up your LiveKit credentials:**
   
   Sign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/), then configure your environment. You can either:
   
   - **Manual setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:
     - `LIVEKIT_URL`
     - `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
     - `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`
   
   - **Automatic setup** (recommended): Use the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup):
     ```bash
     lk cloud auth
     lk app env -w -d .env.local
     ```

3. **Download required models:**
   ```console
   uv run python src/agent.py download-files
   ```
   This downloads [Silero VAD](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/vad/) and the [LiveKit turn detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/turn-detector/) models.

4. **Test your agent:**
   ```console
   uv run python src/agent.py console
   ```
   This lets you speak to your agent directly in your terminal.

5. **Run for development:**
   ```console
   uv run python src/agent.py dev
   ```
   Use this when connecting to a frontend or telephony. This puts your agent into your LiveKit Cloud project, so use a different project if you don't want to affect production traffic.


## Customize your agent

Once your agent is running, enhance it for your use case:

- **Customize AI models**: LiveKit supports dozens of models through LiveKit Cloud and a collection of third-party plugins. See the [models documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/models/) for available options including LLM, STT, TTS, and realtime providers.

- **Add tests**: You can add a full test suite to your agent. See the [testing documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/testing/) for more information.

- **Build reliable workflows**: For complex agents, use [tasks and handoffs](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/workflows/) instead of long instruction prompts. This minimizes latency and improves reliability by structuring your agent into focused, reusable components.

### Get help from AI coding assistants

**Supercharge your development** with AI coding assistants that understand LiveKit. This project works seamlessly with [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), and other AI coding tools.

**Install the LiveKit Docs MCP server** to give your AI assistant access to LiveKit documentation:

**For Cursor:**
[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](https://cursor.com/en-US/install-mcp?name=livekit-docs&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2RvY3MubGl2ZWtpdC5pby9tY3AifQ%3D%3D)

**For Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http livekit-docs https://docs.livekit.io/mcp
```

**For Codex CLI:**
```bash
codex mcp add --url https://docs.livekit.io/mcp livekit-docs
```

**For Gemini CLI:**
```bash
gemini mcp add --transport http livekit-docs https://docs.livekit.io/mcp
```

**Customize the AI assistant context**: The project includes an [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) file that guides AI assistants on how to work with this codebase. **Edit this file** to add your own project-specific context, patterns, and preferences. Learn more at [https://agents.md](https://agents.md).
